# NanoSoft License for Software (NSLS)

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the NanoSoft License! This document lays out the rules for using our software. By using the software, you agree to follow these rules. If you don’t agree, please don’t use it.

## 2. What’s Covered
This license applies to the software you’ve received from NanoSoft, including any updates or documentation that comes with it.

## 3. Who You Are
You’re the “Licensee,” meaning you’re the one using our software.

## 4. Using the Software
You can use the software in your everyday life—whether for personal tasks or business projects. We want you to make the most of it!

## 5. What You Can’t Do
While we want you to enjoy the software, there are a few things you cannot do:
- **No Modifying**: Don’t change or alter the software in any way.
- **No Sharing**: Please don’t give it away, sell it, or distribute it to others.
- **No Reverse Engineering**: Don’t try to figure out how the software works by dissecting it or taking it apart.

## 6. Keeping Your License Valid
To keep your license valid, you must:
- Include this license in every source code file that uses the software.
- If you have a main file (like the one that starts with `int main()`), put this license at the top.

## 7. What Happens If You Break the Rules
If you violate any part of this license, you’ll lose your right to use the software. This means you’ll need to stop using it and delete any copies you have.

## 8. No Warranties
We provide the software as-is. This means we don’t guarantee it will work perfectly or that it will meet your expectations.

## 9. Limitation of Liability
If something goes wrong while using the software, NanoSoft isn’t liable for any damages or issues that arise. You use the software at your own risk.

## 10. Indemnification
If someone tries to sue us because of your use of the software, you agree to help us out and cover any related costs.

## 11. Legal Stuff
This agreement is governed by the laws of your area. Any disputes will be handled in your local courts.

## 12. The Whole Agreement
This document is the entire agreement between you and NanoSoft regarding the software. It replaces any previous discussions we may have had.

## 13. Making Changes
If we need to make changes to this agreement, they must be in writing and signed by both parties. Just because we let something slide once doesn’t mean it’s a permanent change.

## 14. If Part of This License Doesn’t Hold Up
If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid, the rest of it still applies.

## 15. Assignments
You can’t transfer your license to someone else without our permission, but we can transfer it without asking you.
